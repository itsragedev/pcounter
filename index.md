# pCounter Discord Bot

Congrats, you have landed on a discord bot's webpage.

This is pCounter, a useless discord bot. I originally created it to learn how to deploy Node.js code to Heroku. (I have failed miserably)

Anyways, here are reasons why you should add this bot:
 - It is open-source
 - that's literally it.

Click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=908292475536412672&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to add the bot to your server. (Not recommended)
