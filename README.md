Originally created to learn how to deploy Node.js code to Heroku. (I failed miserably)

Anyways, this bot is here just because why not lmao. If you want to add this bot, don't do it. Just don't. Still want to? [Here you go](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=908292475536412672&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands). (you will regret it)
