## About

Originally created to learn how to deploy Node.js code to Heroku. The code is here on GitHub because it would not require me to use the Heroku CLI and thus, save myself from all the (nonexistent) hassle.

## Usage

Add pCounter to your server using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=908292475536412672&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands). Type /help to view the help screen. Easy as that lmao

## Contribute

Spotted a bug, missing a feature or just want to help out? Sure thing, just start a pull request. If you have a suggestion, but you can't code (or you're too lazy), post it in the Discussions tab. If it is a good one, I'll be sure to implement it soon.

## Self-hosting an instance of pCounter

Every time a new version of the bot is released, a release containing all the necessary files and a guide on how to run the bot is put up on the Releases tab. Download the latest version from there, unzip the file and follow the instructions in the guide.txt file.
